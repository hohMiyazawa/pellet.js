A just-for-fun project to get used to javascript classes.
New features every now and then, or perhaps never.

<hr>

If you want to use it:

1. Include the script pellet.js on your page.
2. Create an empty div.
3. Spin up a new simulator with "new Pellet(referenceToDiv)". (look in the index.html file if you are still not sure)
